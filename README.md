# Student Management System

## Overview
The **Student Management System** is a Java-based application designed to manage students, modules, and related data. This project streamlines the management process by providing a structured system to handle student information and course modules efficiently.

## Description
The **Student Management System** is a comprehensive application designed to simplify the process of managing students and their associated academic modules. Built using Java, this system provides a user-friendly interface for administrators, teachers, or school staff to efficiently handle student records and course modules.

### Key Components
1. **Student Management**:
    - **Student Records**: Easily create, update, and manage student details such as names, IDs, and enrollment status.
    - **Enrollment**: Manage the modules that students are enrolled in, allowing for quick access to their academic records.

2. **Module Management**:
    - **Module Details**: Add and manage information about various academic modules, including module names, codes, and descriptions.
    - **Student Enrollment in Modules**: Assign students to specific modules and track their progress and performance.

### Objectives
The primary goal of this project is to create a robust and scalable system that reduces the administrative burden associated with managing student information and academic modules. By leveraging object-oriented programming principles, this application ensures that the data is well-organized, easy to manipulate, and secure.

### Use Cases
- **Educational Institutions**: Schools, colleges, and universities can use this system to manage their student databases and course offerings.
- **Tutoring Centers**: Small to medium-sized tutoring centers can keep track of their students and the subjects they are enrolled in.
- **Online Learning Platforms**: The system can be adapted to manage students and courses for e-learning platforms.

## Features
- **Student Management**: Add, update, and delete student records.
- **Module Management**: Manage course modules, including module details and the students enrolled.
- **Data Storage**: Persist student and module data for retrieval and updates.

## Project Structure
The project consists of the following main files:

- **StudentManagementSystem.java**: The main class that manages the overall functionality of the application.
- **Student.java**: The class representing a student, containing attributes such as name, ID, and enrolled modules.
- **Module.java**: The class representing a module, containing attributes such as module name, code, and the list of enrolled students.
